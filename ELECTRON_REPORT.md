# Electron Migration Report

This report analyzes the effort required to migrate the existing Next.js application to a desktop application using Electron and React.

## 1. Executive Summary

The migration is **moderately complex**. The core UI, component library, and canvas functionality are built with React and can be largely reused. The main challenge lies in replacing the Next.js-specific backend, including API routes, server actions, and data fetching, with Electron's main process and IPC (Inter-Process Communication) mechanisms. The application's current "debug mode" state, which removes authentication and other cloud dependencies, significantly simplifies the initial migration.

## 2. Analysis of the Current Architecture

| Component | Technology | Reusability in Electron | Migration Effort | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend Framework** | Next.js / React | High (React part) | High | All Next.js features (routing, server-side rendering, API routes, server actions) must be replaced. The React code is highly reusable. |
| **UI Components** | Radix UI, custom components | High | Low | The extensive component library in `components/ui` and other custom components can be directly used in the new Electron app. |
| **Canvas** | ReactFlow | High | Low | The core canvas functionality is a React component and can be reused with minimal changes. |
| **State Management** | React Context | High | Low | The existing providers (`project.tsx`, `node-operations.tsx`) can be reused. |
| **Backend Logic** | Next.js API Routes & Server Actions | Low | High | This is the most significant part of the migration. All backend logic needs to be moved to the Electron main process and accessed via IPC. |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL / Drizzle ORM | Medium | Medium | The app can continue to connect to a remote PostgreSQL database. However, for a true desktop experience, migrating to a local database like SQLite would be better. This would require schema and query adjustments. |
| **Authentication** | Disabled (previously Supabase/Clerk) | N/A | Low | The current disabled state of authentication simplifies the migration. If authentication is needed, it would need to be re-implemented for a desktop context. |
| **File Storage** | (Needs implementation) | N/A | Medium | The file storage needs to be implemented using Node.js `fs` module in the Electron main process to interact with the local filesystem. |
| **Dependencies** | npm/pnpm | High | Low | Most dependencies are JavaScript-based and will work in Electron. Some Next.js specific dependencies (`@next/font`, `@vercel/analytics`, etc.) will need to be removed. |

## 3. Migration Path

### Phase 1: Project Scaffolding

1.  **Set up Electron:** Create a new Electron project with Electron Forge or a similar tool.
2.  **Integrate React:** Set up a React build process (e.g., using Webpack or Vite) for the renderer process.
3.  **Copy React Components:** Move the existing `components`, `hooks`, `lib`, and `providers` directories to the new project structure.

### Phase 2: Frontend Migration

1.  **Create Main Window:** In the Electron main process, create a `BrowserWindow` to render the React application.
2.  **Adapt Entry Point:** Create a new entry point for the React application (e.g., `src/index.tsx`) that renders the main `App` component.
3.  **Replace Next.js Components:** Replace Next.js specific components and functions like `<Link>`, `useRouter`, `redirect`, etc., with their React Router equivalents (or a similar routing library).
4.  **Remove Next.js Dependencies:** Remove all `next` and `@types/next` related dependencies from `package.json`.

### Phase 3: Backend Migration

1.  **Identify Backend Logic:** Go through all `app/api` and `app/actions` files and identify the logic that needs to be moved.
2.  **Implement IPC:** For each piece of backend logic, create a corresponding IPC handler in the Electron main process.
    *   Example: The `createProjectAction` server action would become an `ipcMain.handle('create-project', ...)` handler.
3.  **Update Frontend Calls:** In the React code, replace the `fetch` calls to API routes and direct calls to server actions with `ipcRenderer.invoke` calls to the new IPC handlers.
4.  **Database Connection:** The database connection (`lib/database.ts`) will be initialized in the Electron main process. All database operations will happen in the main process.
5.  **File System Access:** Implement file saving and loading using Node.js `fs` module in the main process, exposed to the renderer process via IPC.

### Phase 4: Polish and Packaging

1.  **Desktop-Specific Features:** Add desktop-specific features like native menus, dialogs, and notifications.
2.  **Build and Package:** Use Electron Forge or a similar tool to package the application for different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).

## 4. Challenges and Considerations

*   **Security:** Care must be taken to not expose Node.js primitives to the renderer process (`nodeIntegration: false`, `contextIsolation: true`). All Node.js access should be done through a preload script and IPC.
*   **Performance:** For large-scale data processing, care must be taken to not block the main process. Long-running tasks should be moved to worker threads.
*   **Developer Experience:** The development workflow will change from the simple `next dev` to running the Electron app and the React development server concurrently.

## 5. Conclusion

The migration is a feasible but significant undertaking. The reusability of the React components is a major advantage. The main effort will be in re-implementing the backend logic in the Electron main process. The project's current "debug mode" state makes this a good time to attempt such a migration, as the complexity is reduced. A phased approach, as outlined above, is recommended.
