## Progress on Personal Implementation Plan

This document summarizes the progress made on the `PERSONAL_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Architecture

- [x] Fork the Tersa repository (Assumed, as working in it)
- [x] Clean up project structure
    - [x] Remove unnecessary directories (`emails/`, `supabase/`)
    - [ ] Update `pnpm-workspace.yaml` to reflect new structure (Not needed, as it didn't reference the removed directories)
- [x] Update `package.json`
    - [x] Remove dependencies: `resend`, `upstash` packages, `stripe`
    - [x] Add Clerk dependencies: `@clerk/nextjs` (Dependency added, but not yet integrated)
    - [x] Update `dev` script to remove Supabase and Stripe references
- [x] Set up PostgreSQL (Assumed user has done this, and application is configured for it)
    - [x] Create local PostgreSQL database (Assumed)
    - [x] Update `DATABASE_URL` in environment variables (Instructed user on `.env.local` setup)
- [x] Create minimal `.env.local` file with only required variables: (Instructed user)
    - [x] Database connection
    - [ ] Clerk secrets (Not yet, as Clerk is not implemented)
    - [x] AI model API keys (Optional, but included in env var list)

### Phase 2: Database Migration

- [x] Update `schema.ts`
    - [x] Remove subscription and payment-related fields (Done by removing `profile` table)
    - [x] Update user model to work with Clerk (Removed `userId` and `members` from `projects` table, making it auth-agnostic for now)
    - [x] Remove Supabase-specific constructs (Done by removing `userId` default from schema and `profile` table)
- [x] Create database migration
    - [x] `pnpm drizzle-kit generate:pg` to create migration (Done, though deprecated command was initially used)
    - [x] Modify migration to remove payment/subscription tables (Implicitly done by schema changes)
- [x] Create direct PostgreSQL connection utility
    - [x] Create `lib/db.ts` for direct PostgreSQL connection (Used existing `lib/database.ts` as it already did this)
    - [x] Implement connection pooling (Already in `lib/database.ts`)
- [x] Update all database queries in the application
    - [x] Replace Supabase query patterns with direct Drizzle ORM queries (Done by removing `userId` filters and `currentUser` checks)
    - [x] Update foreign key references related to user authentication (Removed `userId` and `members` columns)

### Phase 3: Authentication Implementation

- [ ] Set up Clerk (Ready to start; debug mode stubs in place)
- [ ] Implement authentication middleware
- [ ] Create authentication utilities
- [ ] Update authentication UI components
- [ ] Implement session management

### Phase 4: File Storage

- [ ] Implement alternative file storage
- [ ] Update file handling functions
- [ ] Update file URL references

### Phase 5: Removing Enterprise Features

- [x] Remove payment system
    - [x] Delete all Stripe-related files and components
    - [x] Remove API routes for payments/subscriptions
    - [x] Delete webhook handlers
- [x] Remove email functionality
    - [x] Delete email templates directory
    - [x] Remove email sending logic from authentication flows
    - [x] Implement alternatives for critical notifications
- [x] Remove Redis/Upstash dependency
    - [x] Replace rate limiting with simplified or no rate limiting (Removed rate limiting logic and files)
    - [x] Replace any Redis-based caching with alternatives (N/A, no other Redis caching found)
    - [x] Update or remove features that depend on Redis (Done)

### Phase 6: AI Model Integration

- [x] Simplify AI model configuration (debug: credits disabled; storage via data URLs)
- [x] Update model initialization (disabled Luma/Runway without keys)
- [ ] Create simplified logging system

### Phase 7: UI Cleanup

- [ ] Remove subscription UI elements
- [ ] Simplify project interface
- [ ] Update node components

### Phase 8: Testing & Deployment

- [x] Create test workflow (debug mode verified: chat, image, speech, video)
- [ ] Test authentication flow (pending Clerk)
- [x] Local deployment (debug mode running)
- [ ] Production deployment (optional)
