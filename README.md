## Usage

1. Login or create an account
2. Create a new project or open an existing one
3. Add nodes to your canvas by clicking the toolbar buttons
4. Connect nodes by dragging from one node's output to another node's input
5. Configure node settings as needed
6. Run your workflow to process data through the AI models

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Boost your productivity with these keyboard shortcuts:

- **`Cmd+A`** (Ctrl+A): Select all nodes
- **`Cmd+D`** (Ctrl+D): Duplicate selected nodes  
- **`Cmd+C`** (Ctrl+C): Copy selected nodes
- **`Cmd+V`** (Ctrl+V): Paste nodes
- **`Cmd+Enter`** (Ctrl+Enter): **Generate content on all transform nodes**
- **`Backspace`/`Delete`**: Remove selected nodes or connections

The **`Cmd+Enter`** shortcut is particularly powerful - it triggers content generation on all transform nodes in your workflow simultaneously, perfect for processing complex multi-step workflows.
